# The Replication and Generalizing of Reinforcement Learning for Overcooked AI 

Files inside the `notebooks` folder are Jupyter notebooks we used to test our implementations


The logic code for this repository is in the `src` folder. The `overcooked_ai_py` folder within this folder contains code forked from Carroll et. al.'s [`overcooked_ai`](https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/overcooked_ai), which we use to model the Overcooked MDP and environment. Code written by us are in the base `src` folder and outlined below: 
- `ppo_agent_clean.py`: our implementation of the PPO agent from scratch
- `ppo_agent_multiprocess`: our implementation of the PPO agent with multiprocessing
- `ppo_agent_stable_baselines`: PPO implementation using the Stable Baselines3 library
- `ppo_agent_helpers.py`: helper functions for the PPO agent
